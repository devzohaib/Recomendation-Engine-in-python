# Recomendation-Engine-in-python
In this project, you’ll learn everything you need to know to create your own recommendation engine.

Through hands-on-workout, you’ll get to grips with the two most common systems

* collaborative filtering 
* content-based filtering

##  Next, you’ll learn how to measure similarities like the 

* Jaccard distance  
*  cosine similarity

and how to evaluate the quality of recommendations on test data using the root mean square error (RMSE). By completing this project, you’ll have built your very own movie recommendation engine and be able to apply your Python skills to create these systems for any industry.
